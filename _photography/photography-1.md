In the summer of 2024, I had the extraordinary opportunity to travel through Afghanistan, capturing moments that tell stories of resilience, beauty, and humanity in a land often misunderstood by the outside world.

*On the same hill as where the giant Taliban flag was, kids were playing soccer near a mosque.*

*It was sunset, we were walking down the street, and some children were following us. I quickly turned and captured the moment.*

These images represent just a fraction of the profound experiences and connections made during my journey through this remarkable country. Each photograph attempts to capture not just the visual beauty, but the dignity and strength of the Afghan people as they navigate their complex present.
